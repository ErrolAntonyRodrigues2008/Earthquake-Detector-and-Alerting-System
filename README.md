This device uses the vibration sensor, when the vibration sensor receives any shakes/vibrations it will trigger an alarm along with a message on the LCD board and also red LED glows.

Project is made to show the working of an actual detection anyways the real detector uses the same principle but more complex and advanced sensor for this purpose.

Now you may think how in this world you are going to test this device! Where is the earthquake for your device to show its working!

The answer is simple, i have made a house and attached motor along with a pulley, This creates vibrations that should be able to detect by the vibration sensor.
